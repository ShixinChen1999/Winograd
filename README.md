# Winograd
In this project, I utilize Chisel, a popular language using for agile hardware description, to generated the corresponding Verilog used by FPGA. The project not only includes the arithmatic operations including Adders and DSP applied as Matrixs-Muplications, but it also has the specialized SRAM reading operations to meet the demand of inputting order of data for Winograd Algorithm.
